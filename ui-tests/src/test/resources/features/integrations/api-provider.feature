Feature: API Provider Integration

  # TODO: test editing integration name (also after publishing)
  # TODO: test operation list sorting and filtering

  Background:
    Given log into the Syndesis
    And clean application state
    And truncate "todo" table


  @api-provider-create-from-spec
  Scenario Outline: Create API provider from <source> spec <location>

    # create integration
    When click on the "Create Integration" link to create a new integration.
    Then check visibility of visual integration editor
    And check that position of connection to fill is "Start"

    # select API Provider as start connection
    When select the "API Provider" connection
    Then check visibility of page "Upload API Provider Specification"

    When create API Provider spec from <source> <location>
    And navigate to the next API Provider wizard step
    Then check visibility of page "Review API Provider Actions"
    And verify there are 5 API Provider operations defined
    #And verify 1 API Provider operations are tagged updating
    #And verify 1 API Provider operations are tagged creating
    #And verify 2 API Provider operations are tagged fetching
    #And verify 1 API Provider operations are tagged destruction
    #And verify 5 API Provider operations are tagged tasks
    #And verify there are 0 errors for API Provider operations
    # these three warnings are ok
    And verify there are 3 warnings for API Provider operations

    #When navigate to the next API Provider wizard step
    When click on the "Next" button
    And click on the "Save" link
    And set integration name "Todo API Provider Integration"
    And click on the "Save" button

    #When finish API Provider wizard
    Then check visibility of page "Choose Operation"
    # TODO: remove the status (no longer shown in UI)
    And check API Provider operation "Create new task" implementing "POST" to "/" with status "501 Not Implemented"
    And check API Provider operation "Delete task" implementing "DELETE" to "/{id}" with status "501 Not Implemented"
    And check API Provider operation "Fetch task" implementing "GET" to "/{id}" with status "501 Not Implemented"
    And check API Provider operation "List all tasks" implementing "GET" to "/" with status "501 Not Implemented"
    And check API Provider operation "Update task" implementing "PUT" to "/{id}" with status "501 Not Implemented"
